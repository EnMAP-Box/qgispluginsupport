Description:  Pale brown silty loam (medial, typic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.alfisol.fragiboralf.coarse.86P1994.spectrum.txt
2.35% organic carbon; 7.9% clay; 74.7% silt; 17.4% sand.

Clay mineralogy: small vermiculite, mica and kaolinite peaks.

Coarse mineralogy: 50% glass, 40% glass aggregate, 10% quartz, and traces 
of plagioclase feldspar and tourmaline.

Spectral Description:  Despite the X-ray analysis, the spectral features in the 
near-infrared look more like those of illite/smectite.  The hydroxyl feature 
near 2.20 microns has a very weak side band near 2.25 microns and another 
weak feature near 2.35 microns.  Likewise, the 2.76 microns band has a 
length and width usual for an illite/smectite and the water band is broadened 
enough to put a steep slope into the reflectance in the near-infrared.  Barely 
discernible H-C absorption bands near 3.4 and 3.5 microns are accompanied 
by a broad, weak hydrocarbon absorption band near 2.50 microns.  Weak 
quartz combination tone bands seen on the long wavelength side of the 
primary volume scattering reflectance peak have relative intensities 
characteristic of fine particle size.  A broad, strong H-O-H absorption band 
near 6.2 microns is followed by an asymmetric peak near 6.7 microns that 
resembles the one characteristic of organic matter.  The relative weakness of 
the hydrocarbon bands at shorter wavelength make this attribution unlikely, 
but chemical analysis does indicate plentiful organic matter.  The quartz 
reststrahlen doublet is weakly displayed between 7.7 and 9.7 microns, with 
its long wavelength flank distorted by the glass reststrahlen.  The broad 
reflectance maximum between the reststrahlen peaks and the very weakly 
expressed alpha quartz doublet is a secondary volume scattering peak, but 
organic matter may contribute to this feature.
