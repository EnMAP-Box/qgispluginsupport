Description:  Brown to dark brown gravelly loam (medial-skeletal, frigid ultic). Original ASTER Spectral Library name was jhu.becknic.soil.alfisol.haploxeralf.coarse.87P313.spectrum.txt
8.54% organic carbon; 4.2% clay; 36.5% silt; 60.2% sand.

Clay mineralogy: weak montmorillonite peak.

Coarse mineralogy: 39% weathered aggregate, 33% quartz, 9% glass, 7% 
plagioclase feldspar, 4% tourmaline, 4% glass-coated grains.

Spectral Description:  This soil contains very abundant organic matter and 
this material dominates the short wavelength part of the spectrum.  The 
strong H-C absorption bands near 3.41 and 3.50 microns are accompanied 
by a broad, strong band near 2.50 microns and weaker features near 2.15 and 
2.27 microns.  No clay hydroxyl features are seen at all. Weak quartz 
combination tone bands are displayed on the long wavelength flank of the 
primary volume scattering reflectance peak, and the intensity of the 5.34 
microns feature indicates that quartz is represented spectrally by fine 
material (larger particles tend to be coated with silt, clay and organic matter).  
The very strong H-O-H absorption band near 6.1 microns and double peak 
near 6.6 microns are due to organic matter.  A very weak quartz reststrahlen 
doublet can be seen between 7.7 and 9.7 microns.  This feature is so weak, 
despite the abundance of quartz, because so many grains are coated and 
because the opacity of the organic matter has subdued all bands.  The broad 
reflectance peak to longerwavelength is probably due to both organic matter 
and secondary volume scattering.
